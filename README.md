# Simple-fast-calculator

It's just a simple calculator made using PHP and HTML. It can calculate upto many numbers you may want and it's really fast in calculating, be it multiplying, dividing, adding or subtracting. I have also added the result time in the calculator so that you can see how fast it works, it differs from 1 second - 5 seconds depending on your host.

More operators will be added soon, stay tuned!
